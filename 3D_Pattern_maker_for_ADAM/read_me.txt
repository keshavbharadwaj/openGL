1)On running the code the user is prometed with the boxes he wants
input has to be comma seperated
example 0,2
2)The user is then prometed with the number of boxes of each type he wants

3D environment
In order to access the box we use the number keys from 0-9 which will each correspond to a perticular box in the 3D environment
so we first select the box we want control by choosing it from 0-9

Control of the boxes
1) The arrow keys will translate the box in left,right and up,down direction.
2) x will translate the box in +ve z direction and z will translate the box in -ve z direction.
3) left click will rotate the box along x axis , right click will rotate the box along the y axis and middle click will rotate the box along z axis

If the user wants to change control from on box to another he can do so by choosing the box using the number key.
